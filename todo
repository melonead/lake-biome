Create Window:
Render two cubes:
    - connect shaders
        - light source  
        - container
Implement a Camera:
    - move(rotational, translational)
    - better camera control, i want the object pointed to by the camera to be visible when i start up
        (are we even pointing at what i think we are pointing at?)

    - set the yaw and pitch only once (the target does not change through out the application)
    - the mouse control should the make the camera rotate around the y-axis
    - clean up the keyboard control of the camera, the camera is moving in unexpected ways
        
Implement Ground:
    - draw the "ground" centered at the world

    - the ground should be a quad, saves all the unnecessary vertices (quad has atmost 6 vertices)
    - probably use a texture to exaggerate the perspective

    - render expansive grounds, using multiple textures perhaps 

Draw axis of the coordinate systems:
    - world space

Abstract all the ground code:
    - put the drawing code in a function
